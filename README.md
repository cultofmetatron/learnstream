Learnstream (Real-time code tutoring)

Everyone's Private Tutor

Khan Academy meets Stack Overflow

You're having trouble solving a problem.
Instead of posting a ticket to Stack Overflow
or trying to find a screencast that is not tailored
to your problem, you come to learnstre.am and write
a text-message-sized description of your problem,
along with a handful of relevant hashtags. Meanwhile,
anyone who is listening for the topics you mentioned in
your hashtags sees your request and selects your 
help request. This brings the two of you together,
in a room where you can remotely write code together,
while video-chatting, thereby allowing you to get
personalized attention from another programmer.

Learn together. Teach each other.
